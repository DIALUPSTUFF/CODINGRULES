# Dial Up Code Styling Rules

###General Rules
In general, there are a few coding principles that we should work towards applying across our coding projects:

- *D.R.Y. Code*: Don't Repeat Yourself by writing modular and resuable code.
- *Comments When Necessary*: Every line of code doesn't need to be commented, but comments should be added where code isn't easily/immediately interpretable.
- *Delete Useless Code & Assets*: If we use Git efficiently, then there's no risk that we will lose access to something that we delete if we need it again in the future. We can delete any code or files that aren't being utilized in a project.
- *Use Branches*: Setup a branch for a new feature and merge it back in when you're done. At any given time, the master branch should only contain safe, well-tested code. Delete branches after they are merged into master.
- *All Caps Repo Names*: For the culture.
